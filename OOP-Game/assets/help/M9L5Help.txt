A licence has a varied role as a legally organised instrument with complex ramifications in the context of legal agreements. It essentially reflects the manifestation of rights and benefits granted to a certain licensee by a licenser after careful planning and coordination.
Within this context, licenses act as a sophisticated structure for coordinating regulated transfers of rights, striking a careful balance between granting the licensee specific entitlements while maintaining the overall ownership and regulatory power vested in the licensor.
The ability of a license to promote a mutually beneficial relationship between the licensor and the licensee, by defining the parameters of allowable behaviour and the range in which this behaviour may be executed, is crucial. 
A license essentially embodies the intricacies of rights, duties, and the preservation of intellectual property and serves as a dynamic framework for negotiating the complicated world of contemporary legal, commercial, and creative relationships.
