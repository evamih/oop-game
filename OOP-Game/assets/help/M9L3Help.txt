A licence is the official permission or permit to do, use, or own something, as well as the document of that permission or permit. 
The choice of license depends on the content owner's goals and intentions for their digital content. For the licensors, a licensing arrangement can generate significant revenue and the licensor's ownership and control of its intellectual property rights are typically very important.
The scope of the licence refers to the set of rights and limitations, granted by a vendor to users or customers. The vendor sets the scope it considers appropriate in the license agreement.
Free and open-source licenses, on the other hand, promote sharing, collaboration, and community-driven development.
