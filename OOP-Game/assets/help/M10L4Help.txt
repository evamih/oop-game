In order to create programming products, key programming concepts like:
     Data structures and algorithms are essential components of programming, facilitating efficient data storage and manipulation. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. These structures enable programmers to organize and access data effectively, optimizing the performance of their applications.

     Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that promotes modular, reusable, and encapsulated code. It offers advantages such as modularity, allowing code to be divided into self-contained units for reuse. Additionally, OOP facilitates encapsulation, protecting data within objects, and abstraction, enabling programmers to hide the complexity of object logic. Inheritance further enhances OOP by allowing modules to be easily expanded and reused within the program or across multiple programs.

     Architectural designs play a crucial role in software development, providing frameworks for organizing and scaling applications. Layered architecture divides systems into multiple layers, each containing modules that collectively solve specific tasks. Microservices architecture decomposes applications into multiple independent services, each performing a distinct function. Client-server architecture, exemplified by web browsers and servers, facilitates communication between clients and servers, enabling requests and responses to be exchanged seamlessly architectural designs ( Layered architecture: each layer has multiple modules that combined solve a specific task, Microservices architecture: multiple services are created, each of the service performing a task, Client-server architecture: most used example of architecture, clients send requests to servers and servers respond to requests. For example, a web browser is a client and a web server is a server.) need to be used together.
